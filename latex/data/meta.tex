Fast SVM on Tree}

\newcommand{\paperAbstract}{
    SVM is important. Solving SVM is time consuming. We approximate the points with a tree. We then propose a new fast computing method for SVM on tree.

    In our experiments, we show that: 1) Our SVM model can be solved faster than the classical SVM, 2) Our SVM model achieve the same (or better) accuracy compared with classical SVM.
